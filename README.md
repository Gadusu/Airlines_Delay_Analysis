# Airlines_Delay_Analysis

Airline delays are a big problem. They cost airlines money, make customers unhappy, and hurt their reputation. This study looks at flight delays from December 2021 to 2023 to see why they happen. We got information from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). This data has 1562 flights with 22 details about each flight, including why they were delayed. By studying this data, we hope to help airlines and airports find ways to make flights run on time more often.
